                      fees, if any, earned by the Partner on or prior to the

                      If the Partner has failed to fulfil his obligations and

                      him the referral fees otherwise owing to him on
                      termination. If the Operator continues to permit activity
                      (generation of revenue) from players after termination,
                      this will not constitute a continuation or renewal of this
                      Agreement or a waiver of termination. The Partner must
                      return to the Operator any confidential information and
                      all copies of it in his possession, custody and control.
                      Both Operator and Partner will be released from all
                      obligations and liabilities to each other occurring or
                      arising after the date of such termination, except with
                      respect to those obligations, which by their nature are
                      designed to survive termination, as set out in this
                      Agreement. Termination will not relieve the Partner from
                      any liability arising from any breach of this Agreement,
                      which occurred prior to termination. In case of
                      termination, the referral commission will be calculated
                      until the date of termination and the Partner may create
                      an electronic invoice until the end of the calendar month
                      following the termination. After expiration of that
                      calendar month, no more invoices may be created by the
                      Partner and the Partner is not entitled to any further
                      refunds or any other claims for compensation against
                      Operator after such termination. The remaining money on
                      the online wallet will not be transferred to the Partner,
                      if he does not create an electronic invoice until the end
                      of the month, following the closing of the account. If the
                      commission does not exceed the minimum amount of EUR 20,
                      no invoice can be created by the Partner and the referral
                      commission shall be forfeited to Heroic Affiliates

                      this Agreement shall be satisfied solely from the referral
                      commission generated and is limited to direct damages.
